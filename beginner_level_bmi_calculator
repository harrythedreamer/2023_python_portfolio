BMI CALCULATOR

The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure that uses your height and weight to work out if your weight is healthy.
BMI formula: BMI = (weight in pounds x 703) / (height in inches ^ 2) 

BMI categories:
- Underweight:       BMI < 18.5
- Normal weight:     18.5 <= BMI < 25
- Overweight:        25 <= BMI < 30
- Obesity:           30 <= BMI < 35
- Severe obesity:    35 <= BMI < 40
- Morbid obesity:    40 <= BMI

name  = input("What is your name?")
weight = float(input("Type your weight in pounds"))
height = float(input("Type your height in inches"))
bmi = (weight * 703) / (height ** 2)
print("your bmi is: ", bmi)
if bmi > 0:
    if(bmi < 18.5):
        print(name + ", you are underweight")
    elif(bmi < 25):
        print(name + ", you are normal weight")
    elif(bmi < 30):
        print(name + ", you are overweight")
    elif(bmi < 35):
        print(name + ", you are obese")
    elif(bmi < 40):
        print(name + ", you are severely obese")
    else:
        print(name + ", you are morbidly obese")
else:
    print("invalid input, please try again")

your bmi is:  22.71816272951196
